# # Array and Hash access

# ### A. Given the following data structure:
a = ["Anil", "Erik", "Jonathan"]

# 1. How would you return the string `"Erik"`?
p a[1]
# 1. How would you add your name to the array?
p a << "Jorge"


# ### B. Given the following data structure:
h = {0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", :two => "Two", "two" => 2}

# 1. How would you return the string `"One"`?
p h[1]
# 1. How would you return the string `"Two"`?
p h[:two]
# 1. How would you return the number `2`?
p h["two"]
# 1. How would you add `{3 => "Three"}` to the hash?
h[3] = "Three"
# 1. How would you add `{:four => 4}` to the hash?
h.merge!({:four => 4})
p h


# ### C. Given the following data structure:
is = {true => "It's true!", false => "It's false"}

# 1. What is the return value of `is[2 + 2 == 4]`?
p is[2 + 2 == 4]
# 1. What is the return value of `is["Erik" == "Jonathan"]`?
p is["Erik" == "Jonathan"]
# 1. What is the return value of `is[9 > 10]`?
p is[9 > 10]
# 1. What is the return value of `is[0]`?
p is[0] # Gotcha: 0 is not false
# 1. What is the return value of `is["Erik"]`?
p is["Erik"]


# ### D. Given the following data structure:
users = {
  "Jonathan" => {
    :twitter => "tronathan",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 42, 75],
  },
  "Erik" => {
    :twitter => "sferik",
    :favorite_numbers => [8, 12, 24],
  },
  "Anil" => {
    :twitter => "bridgpal",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 14, 85],
  },
}

# 1. How would you access Jonathan's Twitter handle (i.e. the string `"tronathan"`)?
p users["Jonathan"][:twitter]
# 1. How would you add the number `7` to Erik's favorite numbers?
users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers] << 7
# 1. How would you add yourself to the users hash?
users["Joel"] = {:twitter => "edwardawkward", :favorite_numbers => [666, 777, 308, 12]}
# 1. How would you return the array of Erik's favorite numbers?
p users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers]
# 1. How would you return the smallest of Erik's favorite numbers?
p users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers].min
# 1. How would you return an array of Anil's favorite numbers that are also even?
p users["Anil"][:favorite_numbers].select { |n| n.even? }
# 1. How would you return an array of the favorite numbers common to all users?
p users["Jonathan"][:favorite_numbers] & users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers] & users["Anil"][:favorite_numbers] & users["Joel"][:favorite_numbers]
# Fancier version:
# users.map { |username, data| data[:favorite_numbers] }.inject(&:&)
# More explicit fancy version:
# users.map { |username, data| data[:favorite_numbers] }.inject { |memo, n| memo & n }
# 1. How would you return an array containing all users' favorite numbers, sorted, and excluding duplicates?
p users.map { |username, data| data[:favorite_numbers] }.flatten.sort.uniq
# binding.pry
